In this project, I analyze employee attrition using HR analytics data to improve retention and demonstrate how HR analytics can be leveraged to gain actionable insights and drive strategic decisions in human resource management. The employee attrition analysis employs various data management and visualization tools, including Power BI, Excel, Tableau, and MySQL.

**Impacts of Attrition:**

a)Financial Costs: Recruitment, onboarding, and lost productivity 

b)Knowledge Loss: Institutional knowledge departs with the employees

c)Decreased Morale: Lowers team spirit and motivation

d)Damaged Reputation: High turnover can be a red flag to potential hires

**Importance of HR Analytics:**

a)Enhances decision-making with data-driven insights

b)Helps in understanding trends and identifying potential risk factors

c)Identifies employees at risk of leaving and enables timely intervention

d)Assists in developing strategies to improve employee retention, thereby enhancing organizational health and performance.

In this project, we created KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for the dashboard. The KPIs are listed below:

1)Average Attrition Rate for All Departments

2)Average Hourly Rate of Male Research Scientists

3)Attrition Rate vs. Monthly Income Statistics

4)Average Working Years for Each Department

5)Job Role vs. Work-Life Balance

6)Attrition Rate vs. Years Since Last Promotion

All the insights for all the KPIs are mentioned in the PowerPoint file. https://github.com/shaileshrnsingh/HR-Analytics/blob/main/Bank%20loan%20analysis.pptx
